# ZenithPay — Spend Agent Skill

Security middleware for AI agents that spend money. Policy-enforced x402 payments on X Layer.

**Base URL:** `https://api.usezenithpay.xyz`

---

## Onboarding

Run this check at the start of every session before anything else.

### Step 1 — Check for existing wallet

```bash
cat ~/.zenithpay/config.json 2>/dev/null
```

If the file exists and contains a valid `agentAddress` — load it and skip to Step 5.

If the file does not exist or is empty — continue to Step 2.

### Step 2 — Create agent wallet

Ask the user for their email address:

```
To create your ZenithPay agent wallet, I need your email address.
This creates a TEE-secured wallet via OKX Agentic Wallet.
No private key will be stored on your machine — the key lives in OKX's secure enclave.

What is your email?
```

Once the user provides their email, call:

```bash
curl -s -X POST https://api.usezenithpay.xyz/wallet/genesis \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email": "<user-email>", "label": "agent-wallet"}'
```

On success you receive `{ agentAddress, label, createdAt, message }`.

### Step 3 — Store config locally

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.zenithpay
cat > ~/.zenithpay/config.json << EOF
{
  "agentAddress": "<agentAddress from response>",
  "createdAt": "<createdAt from response>"
}
EOF
```

Tell the user:

```
✅ Agent wallet created: <agentAddress>

No private key is stored — your wallet is secured by OKX TEE infrastructure.
Compare: other tools store raw private keys locally. ZenithPay stores only your address.
```

### Step 4 — Activate agent (human must do this)

The agent wallet exists but cannot spend yet. A human must set the spend policy onchain.

Tell the user:

```
⚠️  This agent cannot spend yet.

A human must activate it by setting a spend policy.
Open this link in your browser:

→ https://usezenithpay.xyz/onboarding?agent=<agentAddress>

Steps:
1. Connect your wallet (OKX Web Wallet or MetaMask)
2. Set spend limits (or choose a preset)
3. Sign the transaction onchain
4. Return here when done

This ensures you remain in control of how the agent uses funds.
The policy is enforced by a smart contract on X Layer — ZenithPay cannot override it.
```

Wait for the user to confirm they have completed the dashboard step before continuing.

### Step 5 — Verify policy is active

```bash
curl -s "https://api.usezenithpay.xyz/limits?address=<agentAddress>" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $ZENITHPAY_API_KEY"
```

If `perTxLimit` and `dailyBudget` are non-zero — policy is active. Tell the user:

```
✅ Policy detected. Agent is ready to spend.

Limits:
- Per transaction: $<perTxLimit>
- Daily budget: $<dailyBudget>
- Remaining today: $<remainingDailyBudget>
```

If policy is still zero — ask the user to complete the dashboard step and try again.

### Setup complete

Set these in the agent environment from config:

```bash
export AGENT_ADDRESS=$(cat ~/.zenithpay/config.json | grep agentAddress | cut -d'"' -f4)
```

The agent is now ready to use all ZenithPay tools.

---

## Setup

Set these environment variables before using ZenithPay tools:

```
AGENT_ADDRESS=0x...       # Your agent wallet address on X Layer
ZENITHPAY_API_KEY=...     # API key from your human account
```

---

## Mandatory call order — follow this every session

Every session that involves spending must follow this order. Do not skip steps.

```
1. zenithpay_get_limits()       → understand your policy before any spend
2. zenithpay_balance()          → confirm funds are available
3. zenithpay_verify_merchant()  → safety check the merchant before paying
4. zenithpay_pay_service()      → execute the payment
5. zenithpay_ledger()           → review audit trail at end of session
```

---

## Tools

### zenithpay_get_limits

Call this first at the start of every session. Reads the agent's current onchain spend policy.

```
GET /limits?address=${AGENT_ADDRESS}
Authorization: Bearer ${ZENITHPAY_API_KEY}
```

Returns: `perTxLimit`, `dailyBudget`, `remainingDailyBudget`, `allowlist`, `approvalThreshold`, `policyContract`

If `remainingDailyBudget` is less than your intended spend, do not proceed. Tell the user the budget is exhausted.

---

### zenithpay_balance

Check wallet funds before spending. Call after `zenithpay_get_limits`.

```
GET /wallet/balance?address=${AGENT_ADDRESS}
Authorization: Bearer ${ZENITHPAY_API_KEY}
```

Returns: `USDC` balance, `OKB` balance, `remainingDailyBudget`

If USDC balance is insufficient, ZenithPay will auto-swap OKB to USDC internally — but only if OKB balance is sufficient to cover the swap. If both are zero, do not proceed.

---

### zenithpay_verify_merchant

Run this before paying any merchant you have not paid before. Executes an OKX security scan and checks the agent's allowlist.

```
POST /verify-merchant
Authorization: Bearer ${ZENITHPAY_API_KEY}
{ "merchantUrl": "https://service.xyz/api" }
```

Returns: `safe` (boolean), `allowlisted` (boolean), `riskLevel`, `scanResult`, `warning` (if any)

If `safe: false` — do not proceed. Report the warning to the user and stop.
If `allowlisted: false` and the agent policy has an allowlist set — the payment will be blocked onchain regardless. Tell the user to add the merchant via the dashboard before retrying.

---

### zenithpay_pay_service

Execute a policy-gated x402 payment. The onchain SpendPolicy contract is checked before any money moves. Auto-swap from OKB to USDC happens internally if needed — the agent does not need to trigger this manually.

```
POST /pay
Authorization: Bearer ${ZENITHPAY_API_KEY}
{
  "agentAddress": "${AGENT_ADDRESS}",
  "serviceUrl": "https://service.xyz/api",
  "maxAmount": "0.25",
  "intent": "Research DeFi trends on X Layer"
}
```

The `intent` field is required. It must be a human-readable description of why the agent is spending. It is logged onchain permanently.

**Responses:**

`status: "approved"` — payment settled onchain. `txHash` is included. Report the txHash to the user.

`status: "pending"` — payment exceeded the `approvalThreshold`. It is queued for human review at `GET /approvals`. Tell the user a payment is waiting for their approval. Do not retry.

`status: "blocked"` — policy violation. The `reason` field explains why. Report the reason and do not retry the same payment.

Block reasons and what they mean:
- `per_tx_limit_exceeded` — amount is above the per-transaction cap. Reduce `maxAmount`.
- `daily_budget_exceeded` — agent has spent its daily budget. Wait for reset or ask human to raise the limit.
- `merchant_not_allowlisted` — this merchant is not on the agent's allowlist. Ask human to add it.
- `insufficient_balance` — not enough USDC or OKB to cover the payment and any swap.
- `swap_quote_failed` — OKX DEX could not produce a swap quote. Try again later.
- `payment_failed` — x402 settlement failed after policy cleared. Try again.

---

### zenithpay_set_limits

Update the agent's spend policy onchain. This requires a human EOA signature — the agent cannot change its own limits. Only call this when the human has explicitly requested a policy update and has provided a signature.

```
POST /limits
Authorization: Bearer ${ZENITHPAY_API_KEY}
{
  "agentAddress": "${AGENT_ADDRESS}",
  "perTxLimit": "0.25",
  "dailyBudget": "3.00",
  "allowlist": ["exa.ai", "firecrawl.dev"],
  "approvalThreshold": "0.10",
  "humanSignature": "0x..."
}
```

Returns: `status: "deployed"`, `policyContract`, `txHash`

---

### zenithpay_ledger

Query the agent's full transaction audit trail. Call at the end of every session.

```
GET /ledger?address=${AGENT_ADDRESS}&limit=20&status=approved
Authorization: Bearer ${ZENITHPAY_API_KEY}
```

Optional query params: `limit` (default 20, max 200), `offset`, `status` (`approved`, `blocked`, `pending`, `denied`)

Returns: array of transactions with `merchant`, `amount`, `intent`, `status`, `txHash`, `timestamp`, `swapUsed`, `okbSpent`

---

## Approval queue

If a payment returns `status: "pending"`, it is waiting in the human's approval queue. The agent cannot approve its own payments — this is by design. Tell the user to visit the dashboard or use:

```
GET /approvals
Authorization: Bearer ${ZENITHPAY_API_KEY}
```

To approve: `POST /approvals/:id/approve`
To deny: `POST /approvals/:id/deny`

---

## Rules

- Never call `zenithpay_pay_service` without first calling `zenithpay_get_limits` and `zenithpay_balance`
- Never call `zenithpay_pay_service` on a new merchant without first calling `zenithpay_verify_merchant`
- Always include a meaningful `intent` string — vague intents like "buy stuff" are not acceptable
- Never retry a blocked payment — report the reason and stop
- Never retry a pending payment — it is waiting for human review
- Never attempt to set limits without an explicit human request and signature
