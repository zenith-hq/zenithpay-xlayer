  {
    question: "Who controls the spend policy?",
    answer:
      "You do. Set per-transaction limits, daily budgets, and an allowlist of approved services. Once set, the policy is enforced on every payment — no one can override it, including ZenithPay.",
  },
  {
    question: "What happens when an agent hits its limit?",
    answer:
      "The payment is blocked before it executes. The call never reaches the service. Every blocked attempt is logged on-chain so you have a full audit trail of what was tried and why it was rejected.",
  },
  {
    question: "Does my agent need to hold USDC?",
    answer:
      "Yes — x402 payments settle in USDC. If your agent holds another token, ZenithPay can auto-swap via OKX DEX before the payment goes out. No manual top-ups needed.",
  },
  {
    question: "What networks are supported?",
    answer:
      "X Layer mainnet. Agent wallets, spend policies, and all payment settlement run on X Layer. The x402 protocol routes payments to any compatible service endpoint.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can I update the policy after setting it?",
    answer:
      "Yes. You can update limits, budgets, and allowlists at any time. Changes take effect immediately on the next payment attempt.",
  },
  {
    question: "How does x402 fit in?",
    answer:
      "x402 is the HTTP payment protocol your agent uses to pay for API calls. ZenithPay's policy layer sits between the agent and the x402 payment — checking limits before funds ever move.",
  },
